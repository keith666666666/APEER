Preface
Purpose of the Document The purpose of this document is to define the design decisions, system architecture, and data flow of APEER, ensuring a clear understanding for developers, testers, and stakeholders. It serves as a reference for the implementation, integration, and maintenance of the system.
Intended Audience This document is intended for:
Developers – To implement the system based on the architecture and component specifications.
Testers – To validate system behavior and ensure it meets design requirements.
Capstone Adviser – To review and guide the project’s technical and design aspects.
Scope of the System APEER is a web-based evaluation platform designed to:
Automate the collection and analysis of peer and self-evaluations.
Use Artificial Intelligence (NLP) to classify comments, detect sentiment, and summarize feedback.
Provide dashboards for students (personal growth) and teachers (class analytics/bias detection).
Operate as a standalone system integrated with Google Workspace.
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose The AI Self and Peer Evaluation System (APEER) aims to provide a fair, efficient, and intelligent evaluation process for students in academic settings. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze, summarize, and evaluate peer and self-assessments, ensuring constructive and unbiased feedback.
1.2. Scope The system includes modules for AI Comment Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Feedback Summarization, and Dashboards for both students and teachers. It integrates with Google OAuth2 for security and uses a Microservice Architecture to handle AI processing.
